C++ Coding Standard:

Comments:

	All forms of comments are allowed, however each form is dedicated to a certain kind of comment.

	//		- Short, one-line comments.  Used for explaining things in code blocks
	/**/	- Multiline comments only.  Used for explaining the purpose of a file or function
	///		- Multiline Comments only.  Used for defining function/variable comments in a file

Classes:
	- Use Class instead of Struct.
		- Structs should be reserved for pure data types.
	- Only single inheritance is allowed.  Any and all multiple inheritance classes will be tossed aside.  Don't waste your time.
	- Friend classes are acceptable except in the case where there would be more than one friend class.

Templates:
	- Should be avoided if there are less than four generic use cases.
		- This is to cut down on compile time and obfuscation of the code base.

Example Class:

class Example : public Parent
{
public:
	Example();
	~Example();
private:
	
}
